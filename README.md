1. Security (Sandbox Model)
Java applets ran inside a sandbox, which restricted dangerous actions.
Two things an applet was NOT allowed to do:
- Read or write files on the user’s local computer
- Access system hardware or run native system commands

2. Modern Replacement
Java Applets have been replaced by:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (logic and animation)

Example:
A bouncing text animation today can be created using HTML to display text,
CSS to style it, and JavaScript with setInterval() or requestAnimationFrame()
to update the text’s position on the screen.

3. Legacy Importance
It is important for developers to know about Java applets because:
- Many legacy systems and old enterprise software were built using them
- Understanding applets helps developers learn how software security evolved
- It shows how web technologies have progressed over time
